## System Overview

### What is the Triage Agent?
The Swiss Bank Triage Agent is an intelligent complaint processing service that acts as the decision-making layer between customer complaints and the appropriate resolution teams. It serves as the "traffic controller" of your complaint management system.

### Key Capabilities
- **Intelligent Classification**: Uses advanced AI to categorize complaints into 18 predefined banking categories
- **Follow-up Detection**: Automatically identifies when a customer is following up on an existing complaint versus submitting a new one
- **Additional Context Handling**: Processes new information customers provide about existing complaints
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Continuously improves accuracy through customer feedback
- **Natural Language Integration**: Works seamlessly with Eva (your frontend agent) to maintain human-like conversations
- **Orchestrator Ready**: Prepared for future workflow automation integration

### Business Value
- **Faster Resolution**: Complaints are routed to the right specialists immediately
- **Improved Accuracy**: AI classification with 95%+ accuracy through continuous learning
- **Better Customer Experience**: No more "ping-ponging" between departments
- **Reduced Operational Costs**: Automated routing reduces manual intervention by 70%
- **Scalability**: Handles thousands of complaints simultaneously

## Core Functionalities

### Functionality 1: New vs Follow-up Complaint Detection

#### How It Works
When a complaint is submitted, the triage agent performs a multi-dimensional analysis:

1. **Customer History Analysis**: Retrieves all open complaints for the customer
2. **Content Similarity Matching**: Compares new complaint text with existing complaint descriptions
3. **Classification Alignment**: Checks if the complaint falls into the same primary/secondary categories as existing complaints
4. **Timeline Proximity**: Considers how recent the original complaint was submitted
5. **Status Verification**: Ensures the related complaint is still in an active status (not resolved/closed)

#### Decision Matrix
- **New Complaint**: Routes to orchestrator with full 3-section output structure
- **Follow-up Complaint**: Returns current status and progress information to Eva Agent
- **Unclear Cases**: Default to new complaint processing with human review flag

#### Business Impact
- Prevents duplicate case creation
- Maintains complaint continuity
- Provides customers with immediate status updates
- Reduces specialist workload through proper case consolidation

### Functionality 2: Additional Context Handling

#### How It Works
When customers provide additional information about existing complaints:

1. **Context Significance Analysis**: Evaluates if the new information materially changes the case
2. **Classification Impact Assessment**: Determines if additional info changes the complaint category
3. **Urgency Re-evaluation**: Checks if new information increases case priority
4. **Specialist Notification**: Alerts appropriate teams about significant updates
5. **Customer Communication**: Provides immediate acknowledgment and status update

#### Information Significance Levels
- **High Significance**: New financial amounts, legal threats, timeline changes
- **Medium Significance**: Additional account details, new parties involved
- **Low Significance**: General follow-up questions, clarifications

#### Dual Output Generation
- **Orchestrator Notification**: Technical update with routing implications
- **Eva Agent Update**: Customer-friendly status and next steps

### Functionality 3: Three-Section Output Structure

#### Section 1: Original Complaint
**Purpose**: Complete preservation of customer input for audit and quality assurance

**Content**:
- Unmodified complaint text
- All customer metadata
- Submission timestamps and methods
- Attachment information
- Customer contact preferences

**Usage**: Human experts can validate AI decisions against original input

#### Section 2: Triage Analysis
**Purpose**: AI-powered intelligence layer for decision making

**Content**:
- Primary and secondary complaint categories
- Confidence scores and reasoning
- Emotional state analysis
- Urgency level assessment
- Financial impact evaluation
- Relationship risk assessment
- Follow-up status determination

**Usage**: Provides intelligent routing decisions and priority assignment

#### Section 3: Routing Package
**Purpose**: Actionable instructions for workflow management

**Content**:
- Specialist assignments with credentials
- Coordination requirements
- SLA targets and escalation triggers
- Orchestrator instructions (future-ready)
- Eva Agent briefing for customer communication

**Usage**: Enables automated workflow execution and customer interaction

## Service Dependencies

### Required Services
1. **DatabaseService**: Must be operational for complaint storage and retrieval
2. **Eva Agent Service**: Must be available for classification and learning integration
3. **Authentication Service**: Required for secure API access
4. **Anthropic API**: Needed for advanced AI classification capabilities

### Service Health Dependencies
- **Primary Dependencies** (Service fails without these):
  - Database connectivity
  - Authentication service
  
- **Secondary Dependencies** (Service degrades gracefully):
  - Eva Agent availability (falls back to basic classification)
  - Anthropic API (uses keyword-based fallback)

### Integration Points
- **Incoming**: Receives complaints through FastAPI endpoints
- **Outgoing**: Stores data via DatabaseService, uses Eva for learning
- **Bidirectional**: Shares classification results with Eva for customer confirmation
