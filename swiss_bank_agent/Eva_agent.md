print("‚úÖ Eva agent initialized with all requirements")
```

    return services["eva"]
```

### Step 3: Add Eva API Endpoints

Copy all the Eva endpoints from `eva_api_endpoints.py` into your `main.py` file.

### Step 4: Update Database Service

Add all the Eva database methods from `eva_database_extensions.py` to your existing `database_service.py`.

### Step 5: Update Database Indexes

In your `create_indexes` method in `database_service.py`, add:

```python
# Add Eva indexes
await self.create_eva_indexes()
```
